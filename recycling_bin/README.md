# Recycling Bin

This directory contains files that have been moved out of the main project because they are:

1. One-time use scripts that have served their purpose
2. Experimental code that is no longer needed
3. Old versions of files that have been superseded
4. Backup files and temporary data

## Organization

- `scripts/` - Contains old/experimental scripts that are no longer actively used

## Important Notes

- Files in this directory are kept for historical/reference purposes only
- They are not maintained and may not work with the current codebase
- If you need functionality from these files, consider rewriting them using the current architecture
- Periodically review and permanently delete files that are no longer of any value

## Archive Policy

Files are moved here rather than deleted completely to:
1. Preserve potentially useful code for future reference
2. Maintain a record of past approaches and experiments
3. Allow easy restoration if needed

However, files that are older than 6 months and have no clear value should be permanently deleted.
